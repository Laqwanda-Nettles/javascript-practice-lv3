# JavaScript Syntax for React

This week, we will have two files to work with: `js-practice/syntax-practice.js` and `react-practice/index.js`.

You will work on `syntax-practice.js` first to get practice with some syntactic sugar commonly used with react.

Then, you'll apply that in a react application in `react-practice/index.js`

Additionally, you will see the use of TailwindCSS and `props` in react. Although you only need to modify two files, you may wish to have a look at index.html to see how tailwind and react are setup in an html file.

## Syntax Practice

In `js-practice/syntax-practice.js`, you will see a series of functions that you need to complete.

## React Practice

In `react-practice/index.js`, you will see three examples of react components. You will need to follow these patterns to create a new component of your own and display it in the browser.

## TailwindCSS

You will see that TailwindCSS is being used in this project. You can see the classes being used in `index.html`. They work a lot like the utility classes in bootstrap. Refer to the [TailwindCSS documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs) to see all the details.

## Props

You will see that props are being passed to the components in `react-practice/index.js`. 

Props are just like "attributes" in HTML. And can be used inside the component to customize the look and behavior of the component.

## Rubric 20 points

- Syntax Practice has 5 TODOS worth 2 points each
- React Practice has 3 TODOS worth 3 points each
- One point for using TailwindCSS effectively
