#Week 2: Arrow Functions

## Instructions

### Complete the Problem Sets

You will find the problem sets in the following files. Open each of these files in your editor and write your solutions. As you go, try-out each function you write. Complete one function before moving on to the next. Be meticulous. Celebrate each small victory. Commit after each function is complete. After you finish a few of these problems correctly, it will get easier and you will have more confidence, and will move much more quickly in the long run, if you do.

#### arrow-functions.js:

This file contains problems related to arrow functions. Complete the tasks inside this file.

#### settimeout.js:

This file contains problems related to using setTimeout with arrow functions. Implement your solutions in this file.

#### map-practice.js:

This file contains problems related to the map method and arrow functions. Solve the problems as instructed.

### Run Each JavaScript File

You can test your solutions by running each file individually using Node.js:

    node arrow-functions.js

    node map-practice.js

    node settimeout.js

Each command will execute the respective JavaScript file, and the results will be printed in the terminal.

#### Run the tests for arrow-functions

To run the tests. First be sure to install the dependencies with:

    npm install

Then run the tests for the arrow functions with:

    npm run test -- -t "Basic Arrow Functions"

You should see them fail until you get them all corrected, at which point, you will see a green check mark next to the test suite.

Note: there are no tests for settimeout or map-practice.
